How to create a "CRDT"

take a set of reducer functions

create an operation out of  {
    reducer,
    args,
    
    something to determine order (lamport counter?),
    id (to skip repeated updates)
}

to get the state from operations, first remove duplicates, then order them, then apply them one at a time to starting state in order.
this way the operations can come in in any order and be repeated, but whoever has the same operations has the same state regardless of order

o4-mini-high says this is actually a crdt... on one prompt, on another it says it is not. I think it serves the same purpose


I plan to implement this later as another optional "bucket" in the provider (may make buckets arbitrary)
