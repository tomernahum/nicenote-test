Squash / snapshot (client story)
1. get ordered list of updates
    - need to filter out ones that came from user & didn't get merged in yet
    - maybe just load straight from server 
2. create snapshot with them, as a single update (process same as any other update, just bigger (ie Y.encodeStateAsUpdate))
3. save the snapshot on server
4. when client requests all state, give them the snapshot + all updates since
5. maybe also provide a request for client to truly get all updates
6. after X time, delete the events that the snapshot already represents
maybe ask for two snapshots
