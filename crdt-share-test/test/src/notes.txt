- need read only permissions
    - can sign all writes with a separate signing key, verify writes are legit
        - ideal: public/private digital signatures. server verifies with public, clients double verify with public
            sadly the good ec25519 is not supported by chrome! and the other one looks sussy baka. maybe everything is :'( 
        - alternative: 
            symmetric hmac secret shared between server and clients, server is now trusted to prevent spam
            + seperate symmetric hmac secret shared between only clients, clients reject messages that don't pass that one (ie sign every message twice)
