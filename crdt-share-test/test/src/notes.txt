- need read only permissions
    - can sign all writes with a separate signing key, verify writes are legit:
    
    - ideal: public/private digital signatures. server verifies with public, clients double verify with public
        sadly the good ec25519 is not supported by chrome! and the other one looks sussy baka.
    
    - alternative: 
        symmetric hmac secret shared between server and clients, server is now trusted to prevent spam
        + separate symmetric hmac secret shared between only clients, clients reject messages that don't pass that one (ie sign every message twice)
        
        can include just one of these and get most of the benefit also (but not all)
        maybe consumer should be able to choose to turn off one they don't care about, if it turns out to be burdensome amount of extra data
