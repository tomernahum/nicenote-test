- Squash/snapshot Functionality!
- delete/wipe doc functionality ()

- proper cryptography key stuff.
    - support multiple keys & while-running key rotation
    - write keys

- error handling down to user (eg max server message size)

- maybe deprecate connect to doc flow, since we want to fetch it before connecting to socket part
- or not. it's possible I got confused thinking that http is faster than spinning up websocket.

- batching of updates to mask frequency of them from server


- server: think about spam prevention story maybe? & integration with a proper authed / customized extendible server (besides cryptography auth)
    - maybe turn backend into library or something idk


- awareness is buggy sometimes!
