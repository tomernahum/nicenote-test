--------------

- proper cryptography key stuff.
    - support multiple keys & while-running key rotation
    - write keys

- error handling down to user (eg max server message size)
- clean up console logs

- deploy for easier cross-device testing


- batching of updates to mask frequency of them from server


- server: think about spam prevention story maybe? & integration with a proper authed / customized extendible server (besides cryptography auth)
    - maybe turn backend into library or something idk


- awareness is buggy sometimes!

Maybe:
- delete/wipe doc functionality? (you can just squash empty doc in prod and delete from sql viewer in dev though)
- maybe deprecate connect to doc flow in 2-server-interface, since we want to fetch it before connecting to socket part
- or not. it's possible I got confused thinking that http is faster than spinning up websocket.

Make sure everything is good

- could abstract bucket from "doc"|"awareness" to be any string, to more easily connect to other crdts or even ordered reducers
