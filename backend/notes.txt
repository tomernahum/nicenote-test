Either
- 1 sqlite database per document
    - this makes eventual scaling (plus bonus edge serving) easily
    - this makes implementing acid transactions w/ multiple documents hard (bad)
        - but within same easier as we can do stuff like lock the whole db which sqlite does
- 1 database for all data
    - can then shard later?
    - point where this becomes slow is probably far in the future tbh

    - there are multiple auto-horizontal-scaling dbs that claim to still have acid transactions. for example cockroachdb, spanner for sql-compatibility, or mongodb
        - for our desired app a little latency is potentially ok as users will have an offline copy...?
    
    it can't be that simple?
